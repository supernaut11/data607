# Effective and Ineffective Displays of Data

The examples shown in this submission for effective and ineffective figures compare visualizations of similar data. Example 1 in each subsection is a display of customer satisfaction data for subway systems, and Example 2 in each subsection is a display of COVID exposure source data.

## Effective Displays

The following subsections provide examples of effective data visualizations. 

### Example 1

This example is taken from the San Francisco Chronicle article "BART's approval rating plummets as riders complain about filth and crime" published in January 2019\footnote{Data from https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/BART-s-approval-rating-plummets-as-riders-13550578.php}. The article explains how customer satisfaction in the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) metro system was impacted by key events and ridership. Figure 1 is used in the article to represent these trends using data collected by BART from 1996 through 2018.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{good_1.jpg}
  \caption{BART customer satisfaction versus ridership and key relevant historical events}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

This visualization is effective because it provides readers with key insights into the trends in customer satisfaction with BART's services without providing excessive ancillary data. The purpose of the chart is clear and a reader can clearly interpret the negative correlation between customer satisfaction and ridership from the plot shown. They should be cautious in drawing conclusions from these two variables alone, as there are many other factors (e.g., economics, population growth) that may contribute to these changes.

The chart also provides historical context for noteworthy events that may have had an impact on ridership and customer satisfaction. This context is provided without cluttering the plot or making the quantitative values unreadable. These provide useful information to the audience, especially since changes in public transportation may not be well-known in the general population. Although this context is useful, readers must also be wary of assuming a causal relationship between these events and changes in the data, and may need to consider whether the events were selectively included to influence opinion.

### Example 2

This example is taken from the Maryland Department of Health's COVID contact tracing data. Health officials surveyed COVID patients throughout the pandemic, asking them to recall potential sources of COVID exposure. These responses are used to determine how the disease is acquired and transmitted throughout communities\footnote{Data from https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/pages/contact-tracing}. Figure 2 provides a summary level view of COVID case exposure sources, and Figure 3 provides a more detailed view of a subset of those data.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{good_2a.png}
  \caption{Summary-level COVID exposure sources based on Maryland Department of Health contact tracing}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{good_2b.png}
  \caption{Detailed COVID exposure sources based on Maryland Department of Health contact tracing}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Each of these figures is effective in conveying important trends and information about COVID transmission and propagation in Maryland. The summary level pie charts in Figure 2 provide high-level insight into what types of settings tend to result in COVID transmission without overwhelming the reader. The summary level view also reports how much data is missing, providing percentages of respondents who did not provide an answer. This transparency allows more refined interpretation of the contact tracing results.

If the reader is interested in further detail, bar charts like that shown in Figure 3 are available for each exposure category. Rather than providing coarse percentage values, the more specific bar charts provide specific case counts for each exposure type. Through this combination of summary and detailed data display, the Maryland Department of Health is effective in conveying important information to the reader about COVID transmission trends.

## Ineffective Displays

The following subsections provide examples of ineffective data visualizations.

### Example 1

This example is taken from the FleetLogging, Inc. study of which subway stations are the most stressful for travelers\footnote{Data from https://fleetlogging.com/most-stressful-train-stations/}. The study used a natural language processing tool, TensiStrength, to analyze stress levels in the text of Google reviews for subway stations across the globe. Researchers built reports on the relative stress levels experienced by travelers in each subway system and provided a ranking for each station. Figure 4 represents the study's findings in New York City.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{bad_1.jpg}
  \caption{New York City subway station stress rankings based on TensiStrength analysis of Google reviews}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The FleetLogging figure is ineffective from a graphical design perspective. The data presented are the stress percentage levels for each subway station in the NYC subway system and could be much better represented using a simple bar chart. This figure is technically a bar chart that wraps around in a circular shape. It is difficult to tell which percentage values are associated with each station since the eye must follow a circular path from the name to the percentage. A simple horizontal or vertical bar chart is much easier to understand.

The format of the figure is also misleading and might cause confusion about the study's findings. Since each bar in the chart is set at a different radius from a concentric circle, the overall area of each bar changes dramatically based on its position in the chart. The minimum stress value is 53.7 percent (Sheepshead Bay) and the maximum stress value is 66.7 percent (Jamaica Center-Parsons/Archer). Although the maximum value is approximately 24 percent larger than the minimum, its bar area is many times larger than that of the minimum. This may cause readers to misinterpret the difference in stress levels as more dramatic than they actually are.

### Example 2

This example is taken from the Illinois Department of Public Health study on COVID-19 case exposure locations\footnote{Data from http://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/location-exposure?regionID=0}. The data in this study were gathered from contact tracing of COVID-19 patients via surveys asking them to recall known exposures that may have led to their infection. Figure 5 represents the relative proportion of case exposure locations.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{bad_2.png}
  \caption{Prevalence of COVID case exposure sources}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The COVID-19 figure is ineffective from a graphical design and informational perspective. Although a pie chart is a good choice for showing relative proportions of the values for a one-dimensional data set, the chart is unreadable because the chart is divided into over 50 sections. The percentage values are unreadable for most of the categories in data and would benefit from a less granular summary-level view of location categories.The problem is exacerbated by the original source not providing another format (e.g., a table) that contains these values. In essence, there is information reported, but lost, due to this ineffective graphic.

The chart may also be misleading since there is no "Unknown" category in the data. Some patients likely responded to the contact tracing questionnaire with an unknown exposure location, but this is not reported as a distinct category from "Other". As a result, the audience cannot interpret the difference between unexplained exposures and those that come from a known but non-specific category. 

# Part 2

This section includes output from the original IntroExercises.R and fixes incorrect code that prevents proper execution.

The three changes that need to be made for this code to work are:

1. Comment out incorrect line `3x`, which was likely introduced as an example to show that multiplication is properly written as `3*x` in R.
2. Load tidyverse library prior to executing functions that require it (e.g., `as_tibble()`).
3. Update path to `mushroom.csv` to match that of the file system on the current machine.

The output of executing this code is shown below.
